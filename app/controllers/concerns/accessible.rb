# Fix cross model visits (fancy name for: Users can visit admins login and viceversa and mess up your auth tokens)
# ActionController::InvalidAuthenticityToken happens when a logged in Devise model (eg. User) logs in,
# in the same browser,
# as another Devise Model (eg. Admin)

# A technical issue with this type of setup, however,
# is that a signed in devise user will be able to access sign in
# and login pages of another devise user. This is definitely not a desired result.
#
# As a solution, a simple concern can be implemented
